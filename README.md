# _Solar Age Calculator_

#### _Week 11 Independent Project for Epicodus, 10.12.2018_

#### By _**Catherine Bradley**_

## Description

_This is a JavaScript program using webpack_

_Solar Age Calculator allows users to find out their age on other planets in the Solar System (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter). The program determines the user's age based on planet's rotation time around the Sun. Given the user's new planetary age, the program returns how many years the user has left to live, or how long the user has been dead, based on average life expectancy in the US (86 years)._
